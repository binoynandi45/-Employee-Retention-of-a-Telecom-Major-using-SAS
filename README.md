Case Study: Fiber bits
Business Objective:
“Fiber Bits” is an internet service provider company. They are in the market from last 10 years. They lost almost 42% of their customers in last 3 years. Some new customers joined during the same time period. But, the company is concerned about the high attrition rate in the customer base. They want to get an idea on what are the main factors that lead to customer attrition.  To reduce the attrition rate, they have introduced vouchers and other benefits program. The objective is to identify the customers who are most likely to quit in next 2 years and try to retain them by offering free vouchers and benefits. 

Problem Statement and Scope of Model
The company has collected around 10000 customer historical data from last three years. We need to build a model that identifies the customers who are most likely to leave. We need to quantify the chance of attrition for each of the customer. The model will be used on the active customers. The free vouchers and benefits will be given to customers with higher probability to attrite in next three years. For example below are two customers, who is most likely to leave. Which customer should we try to retain by sending free vouchers
